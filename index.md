## TLDR
Welcome to my personal site,
I graduated from University of Colorado Boulder in 2025 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor's of Arts in Mathematics.
I speak Mandarin and English, and I come from Arvada, Colorado.
My interests include Origami and Math, Linux and am seeking a job in software development or DevOps/Cloud Engineer.
Have a look around if you are interested in any of my projects.
