# School Projects
## Capstone Project: Sentiment Analysis and Monitoring For Coursera
This project was completed for the capstone course of a BS in Computer Science.
Our sponsor Coursera required us to create a solution for extracting messages from their slack channels and then processing messages using sentiment analysis to determine how courses are going.
To accomplish this, we created a slack bot which continuously downloaded messages and sent them for processing and then storage.
A separate process then created a web interface for graphical visualizations pictured below.
